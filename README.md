# ProxSGD
This is the PyTorch implementation of the ProxSGD algorithm proposed in following paper:

"ProxSGD: Training Structured Neural Networks under Regularization and Constraints," **International Conference on Learning Representation (ICLR)**, Apr. 2020. [URL](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HygpthEtvr)

by *Yang Yang, Yaxiong Yuan, Avraan Chatzimichailidis, Ruud JG van Sloun, Lei Lei, and Symeon Chatzinotas.*

This repository contains the simulations in Section 4.2.

# Baseline
This branch is created to train model with SGD optimizer.

## Setup
Kindly follow the following steps to get experimental results.

1. Create pytorch enviornment.
2. Update config.py with required settings.
3. Change variable 'lr' values for different learning rates and Run main_search_baseline.py 
4. Results can be seen in directory mentioned in config.py
